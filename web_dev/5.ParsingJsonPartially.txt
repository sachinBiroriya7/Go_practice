Till above examples I have just one endpoint/route /words. which had concent 
{"page":"occurrence","words":{"hello":1,"hola":1,"world":2}}

if have anoother route /occurrence, which tells the count of occurrence of a words
{"page":"occurrence","words":{"hello":1,"hola":1,"world":2}}

same logic cant be written for both pages as then words is []string in /words and map[string]int in /occurrence.
this can be handled in 2 ways, creating seprate routes, or In our case

using switch cases, as apart from word all other content remain the same.
if page == word , create word struct for word slice
if page == occurrence, create occur struct for word map
