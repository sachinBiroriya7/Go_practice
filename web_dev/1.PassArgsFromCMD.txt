We can pass argument to by using inbuilt package called “OS” and func Args()
This takes args from the terminal and returns only a slice of string []string.
The first argument passed to the program is always the name of the executable itself.


Access of passed args can be done using Slicing [1:]


Also we can pass argument through adding configuration to a file ,lauch.json 
Here we can add our args
VsCode  > Run  > add configuration  -> creates launch.json
When no args are passed and we want to access the argument through slicing this gives a runtime error, which can be handled as below.

            	if len(args) < 2 {
	            	fmt.Println("No args passed")
	            	os.Exit(1)
	            }
